NAME
    Dist::Zilla::Plugin::BumpVersionFromGit - provide a version number by
    bumping the last git release tag

VERSION
    version 0.006

SYNOPSIS
    In your F<dist.ini>:

         [BumpVersionFromGit]
         first_version = 0.001       ; this is the default
         version_regexp  = ^v(.+)$   ; this is the default

DESCRIPTION
    This does the Dist::Zilla::Role::VersionProvider role. It finds the last
    version number from tags and increments it as the new version used by
    Dist::Zilla.

    The plugin accepts the following options:

    *   first_version - if the repository has no tags at all, this version
        is used as the first version for the distribution. It defaults to
        "0.001".

    *   version_regexp - regular expression that matches a tag containing a
        version. It should capture the version into $1. Defaults to ^v(.+)$
        which matches the default tag from Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Git::Tag

    You can also set the "V" environment variable to override the new
    version. This is useful if you need to bump to a specific version. For
    example, if the last tag is 0.005 and you want to jump to 1.000 you can
    set V = 1.000.

    NOTE -- this module is a stop gap while Dist::Zilla is enhanced to allow
    more sophisiticated version number manipulation and may be deprecated in
    the future once those changes are complete.

SEE ALSO
    *   Dist::Zilla::Plugin::VersionFromPrev and
        Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Git::LastVersion do something similar but in
        what I find to be a more complicated way of doing things
