NAME
    Dist::Zilla::Plugin::BumpVersionFromGit - provide a version number by
    bumping the last git release tag

VERSION
    version 0.001

SYNOPSIS
    In your F<dist.ini>:

         [BumpVersionFromGit]
         version_regexp  = ^v(.+)$   ; this is the default

DESCRIPTION
    This does the Dist::Zilla::Role::VersionProvider role. It finds the last
    version number from tags and increments it as the new version used by
    Dist::Zilla.

    The plugin accepts the following options:

    *   version_regexp - regular expression that matches a tag containing a
        version. It should capture the version into $1. Defaults to ^v(.+)$
        which matches the default tag from Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Git::Tag

    You can also set the "V" environment variable to override the new
    version. To bootstrap a version for a distribution that has not been
    released (and thus not tagged), you need to use this or else set
    "version" in dist.ini (which should prevent this plugin from running).
    After the first tagged release, you can remove "version" from dist.ini
    and let this module handle it for you.

    NOTE -- this module is a stop gap while Dist::Zilla is enhanced to allow
    more sophisiticated version number manipulation and may be deprecated in
    the future once those changes are complete.

SEE ALSO
    *   Dist::Zilla::Plugin::VersionFromPrev and
        Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Git::LastVersion do something similar but in
        what I find to be a more complicated way of doing things
